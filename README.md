On the specified webpage, the icon of the Chrome extension will no longer be grayed out. Clicking open the extension will give the option to select a color and that color will be applied to all `h1` tags on the page when the button "Change" is clicked.

This extension can be easily adjusted to change different elements (the style) of a webpage and can be applied to different webpages.
