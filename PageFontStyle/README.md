## Motivation
The goal of writing this extension is to get a basic understanding of making Chrome extensions.

## Tech/Framework Used
This extension uses JSON, HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery.

## Installation
No installation is required, simply download the folder and save it on the computer that is usually not accessed. Then go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on "Developer Mode" and choose the "Load Unpacked" option. Select the folder of this extension and it will be ready to use in the toolbar.

This extension may not work at during the first attempt and may require the webpage to be refreshed.

## How to Use
This is a very simple Chrome extension, however, it only works on the specified webpage (which has been set as https://developer.chrome.com/*) and grayed out on all other webpages.

On the specified webpage, the icon of the Chrome extension will no longer be grayed out. Clicking open the extension will give the option to select a color and that color will be applied to all `h1` tags on the page when the button "Change" is clicked.
