# SpeakIt Extension

## Motivation
The goal of writing this extension is to get a basic understanding of making Chrome extensions.

## Tech/Framework Used
This extension uses JSON, HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery.

## Installation
No installation is required, simply download the folder and save it on the computer that is usually not accessed. Then go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on "Developer Mode" and choose the "Load Unpacked" option. Select the folder of this extension and it will be ready to use in the toolbar.

After upload, it should appear as below:<br/>

## How to Use
This is a very simple Chrome extension. It does not have a popup but rather it only works when text is selected and then right clicked and select "Read the text out loud" to use (found in the context menu).

The extension will read the selected text aloud using a Google Chrome API. In the toolbar, the Wikit extension will always be grayed out.

The extension can be easily adjusted to change the type of voice, language read and the rate of reading out loud.
